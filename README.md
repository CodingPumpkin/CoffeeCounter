# Coffee Counter
<sub><sup> (get it? it's like 'count' but also like a 'bar counter' where you get drinks)
sorry (╥ ω ╥) </sup></sub>

## Motivation
I made this to get a feel of what's it like coding in D. Also to set up my new working place and make sure it feels right. I've been interested in this language for quite a while now and I finally got some spare time to create a silly little programm.

## Building 

I intend to use dub for all of my D projects. This is my first time working with this utility. There are no additional dependencies here but I felt like using dub was the right thing to do.

Make sure you have dub installed on your system (I use dub 1.38.1). Then just type 
> dub run
and this should do the trick.

## Usage
There is nothing too complicated here. Start the programm and follow the instructions given.
